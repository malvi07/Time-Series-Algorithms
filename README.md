# Time-Series-Algorithms

### Introduction
This project is about comparing different advanced algorithms used for predicting future values in time series data.
The aim is to evaluate and compare the performance of several cutting-edge models, including:
* TFT
* TSMixer
* Patch Time Series
* TimeGPT
* TimesNet


### Datasets


### Benchmark Metrics ("Numbers to Beat")
Will compare the algorithms against established benchmarks in the field of time series forecasting.
