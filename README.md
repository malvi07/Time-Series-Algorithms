# Time-Series-Algorithms

### Introduction
This project is about comparing different advanced algorithms used for predicting future values in time series data.
The aim is to evaluate and compare the performance of several cutting-edge models, including:
* TFT
* TSMixer
* Patch Time Series
* TimeGPT
* TimesNet


### Datasets
This project utilizes two primary datasets:
1. Wind Turbine Scada Dataset: This dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains the 2018 Scada Data of a Wind Turbine in Turkey. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset/code).
2. Wind Power Forecasting: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains two and a half years of data for a windmill. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theforcecoder/wind-power-forecasting/data)

### Benchmark Metrics ("Numbers to Beat")
Will compare the algorithms against established benchmarks in the field of time series forecasting.
